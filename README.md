Would you like them to be even faster? Quite simple! Try Smart FastFood!
We propose an application that allows you to order food without doing a queue, without keeping cash or credit cards and reduce total cost of fast food.

You can scan it with our application which shows to user menù and a form to make an order in a few steps. When user completes his order, it can simple pay with paypal account and after payment the order will be processed. The application will nofity you when order is ready.
